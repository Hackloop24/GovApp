# Problem Statement
_A open platform where a resident can upload problem with some proofs (with extra details like state, district, taluk, panchayat/municipal corporation, pin code) so that authorities can check for the problems in their locality. This also can be viewed by any person using this platform. Once authorities solve the problem, they will respond to the complainant with some proof. The platform also shows the amount of fund allocated to the problem and how the fund is being utilised._

# Notice
This repo is just created for integrating the different components of the platform.
